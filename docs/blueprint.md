## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF), representing innovation and the digital realm, for headers, key interactive elements.
- Background color: Dark navy (#191970), conveying a sense of deep space, future-oriented finance. The low saturation makes it easy on the eyes, while hinting at the same 'blue' hue as the primary.
- Accent color: Cyber Yellow (#FFD300), for highlighting important information, buttons, and interactive components, analogous to electric blue. Slightly lower brightness helps it stand apart.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, with a computerized, techy, scientific feel. In case longer text passages become part of the app, use 'Inter' sans-serif for body text.
- Use glowing, outlined icons with a futuristic aesthetic. Icons should be simple and easily recognizable.
- Implement a modular layout with clear, sectioned dashboards. Use a grid system for organizing content, ensuring a clean and structured interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transactions and data updates. Use smooth transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience.
